# Love-Calculator
A simple python program that calculates your love score
To work out the love score between two people following logic is used:
    1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
    2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
    3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
    4. If the love scores is less than 10 or greater than 90, the message that should be displayed is:
                      "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
    5. For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
                      "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
    6. Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
                      "Your score is *z*."
